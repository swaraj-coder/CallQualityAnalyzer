I'm not really sure if I can afford it right now.\\nSpeaker 1:  All right. Well, here are a few reasons to consider purchasing today.\\nSpeaker 1:  It looks as though you haven't updated your vehicle for three years.\\nSpeaker 1:  So that would be the equivalent of getting three years worth of updates for the price of one.\\nSpeaker 1:  Oh, okay.\\nSpeaker 1:  In addition, special offers like the current promotion don't come around too often.\\nSpeaker 1:  I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the extra $50 off before it expires.\\nSpeaker 0:  Yeah, but it does sound pretty good.\\nSpeaker 1:  If I set this order up for you now, it'll ship out today and for $50 less.\\nSpeaker 1:  Do you have your credit card handy and I can play this order for you now?\\nSpeaker 0:  Yeah, let's go ahead and use your visa.\\nSpeaker 0:  My number.\",\n",
